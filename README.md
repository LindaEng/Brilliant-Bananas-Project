# Brilliant-Bananas-Project Multiverse Final Inventory Project (Chad, Afreen, Sharon & Lindsey)

# Description of our Project:
We built a Brilliant Bananas Inventory App for 4 Warehouses.Where each warehouse displays a list of all items in each aisle.The user can view details of each item like name, price,description and category by clicking on any specific item from the list. A new item can be added in each aisle by submitting the form. An item can also be removed from the warehouse.
